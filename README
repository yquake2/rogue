This is a bugfixed version of id Software's Quake II missionpack
"Ground Zero", developed by Rogue Software. Hundreds of bugs were
fixed, this version should run much more stable than the old
SDK version. While compatible with any Quake II client that uses
the original unaltered mod API, the "Yamagi Quake II Client" is
highly recommended to play the addon. For more information visit
